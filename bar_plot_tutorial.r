#This section is an easy way to set many of the variables that we will use later when plotting. This is a practice you should 
#get familiar with. The reason is, if you need to change something quickly (such as bar colours), you don't have to go 
#search through your script to find it. You can come right here and change it quickly. It is also helpful if you use the
#same variable multiple times. That way, you change it once up here and it all changes below.

#First, change your working directory to the folder with your data
#Data must be laid out as Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, Condition4

#Filenames
filename = "bar_plot_data.txt"
OutputName = "BarPlot.tiff"

#Condition Names
Condition1 = "Delta"
Condition2 = "Theta"
Condition3 = "Alpha"
Condition4 = "Beta"

###Plot for all data###

#Colours of your bars
  barcolours = c("#303030", "#505050", "#707070", "#909090")
#Colours of your error bars
  errorbarcolour = "#606060"
#Y Axis Values range
  barylim = range(-2,6)
#Y Axis label
  barylab = expression(paste("Power (", mu, "V"^2,")", sep ="")) #Power (Î¼V^2)
